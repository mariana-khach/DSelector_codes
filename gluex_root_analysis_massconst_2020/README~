We completed a full analysis launch for the 2020 data set. You can find 984 merged trees for each of the 57 reactions on cache:

/cache/halld/RunPeriod-2019-11/analysis/ver04

Some of the files may have already migrated to tape. Additional information about the launch can be found here:

The information is in the tree name. The default decay of the eta' is to eta pi+ pi-, and the mass of the eta' is not constrained (M35). Both pi0 and eta are mass-constrained by default for this reaction.

If the masses were not constrained, you would see M7 for pi0 and M17 for eta in the name.
